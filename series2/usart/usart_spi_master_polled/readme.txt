usart_spi_master_polled

This project demonstrates polled operation of the USART in synchronous
master mode.  USART0 is configured for SPI-compatible operation at
1 Mbps.  Compatibility with the Synchronous Peripheral Interface standard
implies a word size of 8 data bits transmitted and received MSB-first.

An output buffer is filled with 10 bytes of data (which can be changed by
modifying BUFLEN).  The USART chip select pin (controlled as a GPIO), is
asserted (driven low) to notify a slave device that data will soon be on
the way.

The emlib USART_SpiTransfer() function is used to transmit each byte and
save each byte that is simultaneously received.  USART_SpiTransfer()
polls the buffer level flag (USART_STATUS_TXBL), and, if space is
available, writes a byte to the transmit data register to be sent.  It
then polls the transmit complete flag (USART_STATUS_TXC) to determine
when all bits of this byte have been transmitted, which, in turn, denotes
that all bits of the incoming byte have been received.

After BUFLEN characters have been transmitted and received, the chip
select is de-asserted (driven high), and the process repeats.  A
breakpoint can be set at the call to GPIO_PinOutSet() when the chip
select is de-asserted to inspect the received data.

Peripherals Used:

GPIO
USART0

The CMU is used indirectly via the USART_InitSync() function to calculate
the divisor necessary to derive the desired bit rate.

Test Procedure:

1. Build the project and download it to the Wirelss Starter Kit (WSTK).

2a. If only a single WSTK is available, connect pins 12 and 14 on the
    Expansion Header with a jumper wire.  These are the USART0_RX (MISO)
    and USART0_TX (MOSI) pins, such that connecting them results in the
    master receiving the data it jus transmitted.

2b. If another WSTK is available, compile and download one of the slave
    mode examples to the other board and connect the Expansion Header
    pins as follows:

     Master WSTK         Slave WSTK
    -------------       -------------
    Pin 1  (GND)  <---> Pin 1 (GND)
    Pin 14 (MOSI) <---> Pin 14 (MOSI)
    Pin 12 (MISO) <---> Pin 12 (MISO)
    Pin 10 (SCLK) <---> Pin 10 (SCLK)
    Pin 6  (SSn)  <---> Pin 6  (SSn)

3. Before running the example, set a breakpoint on the GPIO_PinOutSet
   function call that de-asserts the slave select.  Examine the inbuf[]
   array to see the received contents from the slave.  If tested on a
   single WSTK with the USART0_RX (MISO) and USART0_TX (MOSI) pins
   connected together, inbuf[] will hold the same values as outbuf[].

   If tested using another WSTK running one of the slave examples,
   inbuf[] will hold all 0s after the first transmission sequence (slave
   select assertion, for-loop of BUFLEN calls to USART_SpiTransfer, and
   slave select de-assertion).  After each subsequent transmission,
   inbuf[] will hold the same values as outbuf[].
