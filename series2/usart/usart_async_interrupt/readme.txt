usart_async_interrupt

This project demonstrates interrupt-drive operation of the USART in
asynchronous mode.  USART1 is configured for asynchronous operation at
115200 baud with 8 data bits, no parity, and one stop bit (115200N81).
The main loop waits until 80 characters or a carriage return are received
and then echos these back to the user.

================================================================================

Peripherals Used:

GPIO
USART1

The CMU is used indirectly via the USART_InitAsync() function to calculate the
divisor necessary to derive the desired baud rate.

================================================================================

How To Test:
1. Build the project and download to the Starter Kit.
2. Connect a PC to a USB-to-serial converter, such as the Silicon Labs
   CP2102N-EK, which provides access to the CMOS level (3V) RX and TX pins.
3. Connect the RX and TX pins on the USB-to-serial converter to pins 14 and
   12, respectively on the Expansion Header of the Wireless Starter Kit
   Mainboard.
4. Open a terminal program and configure it for 115200N81 operation on the
   serial port assigned to the USB-to-serial converter.
5. Type some characters in the terminal program (they will not show) and press
   Enter to have the MCU echo them.

Listed below are the port and pin mappings for working with this example.

Board: Silicon Labs EFR32xG21 2.4 GHz 10 dBm Board (BRD4181A) 
       + Wireless Starter Kit Mainboard (BRD4001A)

Device: EFR32MG21A010F1024IM32 (this code will run unchanged on any
EFR32MG21 or EFR32BG211 variant so long as the pins used as present).

PA5 - USART1_TX (Expansion Header Pin 12)
PA6 - USART1_RX (Expansion Header Pin 14)

Device: EFR32MG22C224F512IM40 (this code will run unchanged on any
EFR32MG22 or EFR32BG212 variant so long as the pins used as present).

PA5 - USART1_TX (Expansion Header Pin 12)
PA6 - USART1_RX (Expansion Header Pin 14)
