timer_period_measurement_interrupt

This project demonstrates period measurement using the TIMER module. TIMER is
initialized for input capture on Compare/Capture channel 0 for falling edge
capture and interrupts. Upon each interrupt, the captured edge is read from CC0
and compared with the previously captured edge to calculate the period. The
measured period is stored in the measuredPeriod global variable in units of 
microseconds.

Example: for a 1 kHz input signal, the measuredPeriod variable will equal 1000.

Note: The range of frequencies this program can measure accurately is limited.
The minimum measurable period is around 3 microseconds, or 333 kHz. At higher
frequencies accuracy is diminished due to dropout, and above 333 kHz the 
interrupt execution time is longer than the signal period. For methods to 
measure shorter periods, see the timer_pulse_capture example.
