timer_dma_edge_capture

This project demonstrates DMA driven edge capture from a TIMER Compare/Capture
channel. TIMER0 CC0 is configured to capture rising and falling edges. GPIO Pin
PA6 (Expansion Header Pin 14) is to be connected to a periodic signal, and 
edges captured from PA6 are stored in CC0. The LDMA is configured to transfer
the first 512 edges to a fixed length buffer. The buffer is stored globally
for possible future processing.

================================================================================

Peripherals Used:
HFRCO    - 19 MHz
TIMER0   - CC0
LDMA     - Single Byte P2M

================================================================================

How To Test:
1. Build the project and download to the Starter Kit
2. Connect a periodic signal to GPIO Pin PA6 (Expansion Header Pin 14)
3. View the buffer[] global array in the debugger
