timer_single_pulse_generation_polled

This project demonstrates the generation of a single pulse signal using output
compare. TIMER is initialized for output compare on Compare/Capture channel 0,
which is routed to the GPIO Pin specified below. The buffered compare values are
set such that a single pulse is generated.

================================================================================

Peripherals Used:
TIMER0/1 - HFPERCLK (19 MHz for series 2 boards)

================================================================================

How To Test:
1. Build the project and download it to the Starter Kit
2. Use an oscilloscope to measure the GPIO pin specified below
3. A 1 s pulse should be generated after 3.5 seconds
