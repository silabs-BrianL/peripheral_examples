prs_logic_unit

This project demonstrates the built-in PRS logic functions between channels.
PB0 and PB1 are routed to output pins (usually LEDs, but not always.  We'll 
refer to these pins as OUT0 and OUT1).  There are two configurations for this
example: You can use the AND_NEXT option to make Channel 0 AND with Channel 1,
or you can use the OR_PREV option to make Channel 1 OR with Channel 0.

1) You can make Channel 0 (with PB0 and OUT0) AND with Channel 1.  With this 
configuration, the outputs use the following truth table:
PB1   PB0   |   OUT1    OUT0
-----------------------------
0     0     |   0       0
0     1     |   0       0
1     0     |   1       0
1     1     |   1       1

2) Alternativelly, you can make Channel 1 OR with Channel 0.  With this
configuration, the outputs use the following truth table:
PB1   PB0   |   OUT1    OUT0
-----------------------------
0     0     |   0       0
0     1     |   1       1
1     0     |   1       0
1     1     |   1       1


How To Test:
1. Update the kit's firmware from the Simplicity Launcher (if necessary)
2. Build the project and download to the Starter Kit
3. Press the Push Buttons and notice how the output pins respond

Note: You can switch between AND and OR using the "#define USE_AND" line in the main file.
