idac_timer_prs

This example shows how to use a timer to control the IDAC through the PRS. The
IDAC is configured to enable its output based on the signal it receives from PRS
channel 0. The timer generates a square waveform signal that it sends to the
PRS. This project operates in EM1 even though the IDAC works in EM3 because the
timers are only capable of operating up to EM1. An example use case of this
project is PRS triggered charge injection to control current output.

Note: the following devices do not have an IDAC module
 - G (Gecko)
 - GG (Giant Gecko)
 - LG (Leopard Gecko)
 - WG (Wonder Gecko)
 - TG (Tiny Gecko)
 - TG11 (Tiny Gecko 11)

Peripherals Used:
 - IDAC
 - PRS
 - TIMER0
 - HFPERCLK

How To Test:
1. Build the project and download it to the Starter Kit
2. Use a breadboard to make a circuit that has the current output coming from
   the IDAC0_OUT pin going over an external resistor to ground. Also, make sure
   to select a resistor value such that V = I * R does not exceed the voltage
   supply rail (i.e. 3.3 Volts). For example, since the device is configured to
   output 64 microamps by default, one should choose a resistor that has less
   than 51.5 kOhms of resistance.
3. Measure the voltage drop across the resistor on an oscilloscope. If the
   max is equal to V = I * R and the min is equal to zero, then the output is
   correct.
