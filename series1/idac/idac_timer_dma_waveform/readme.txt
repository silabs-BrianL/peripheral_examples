idac_timer_dma_waveform

This example shows how to use a timer and the DMA to output a sinewave using the
IDAC. This project operates in EM1.

This example used about 1.10 milliamps when in EM1. After commenting out the
line of code that puts the device in EM1, this example used about 1.77 milliamps
on average. Note: this energy measurement was done using Simplicity Studio's
built-in energy profiler for the GG11 device with a Debug build configuration and
no optimization flags (gcc -O0).

Note: the following devices do not have an IDAC module
 - G (Gecko)
 - GG (Giant Gecko)
 - LG (Leopard Gecko)
 - WG (Wonder Gecko)
 - TG (Tiny Gecko)
 - TG11 (Tiny Gecko 11)

================================================================================

Peripherals Used:
 - IDAC
 - TIMER0
 - HFPERCLK (14 MHz for series 0 devices) (19 MHz for series 1 devices)
 - DMA/LDMA

How To Test:
1. Build the project and download it to the Starter Kit.
2. Use a breadboard to make a circuit that has the current output coming from
   the IDAC0_OUT pin going over an external resistor to ground (suggested
   resistor values are listed below).
3. Measure the voltage drop across the resistor on an oscilloscope. If the
   voltage min and max on the oscilloscope divided by the resistor value is
   approximately equal to the current range's min and max, then the output is
   correct. Also, the output should look like a sine wave.

The appropriate resistor value is dependent on the range the user wants to use
since the difference between the lowest and highest current output is three
orders of magnitude. The resistor value must be chosen so that the resulting
voltage over it can be measured with the limiting factor that the maximum
current output for that range does not make the voltage over the resistor exceed
the supply voltage. For a current range of 50 nA - 1.6 uA, we suggest using a
500 kOhm resistor. For a current range of 1 uA - 64 uA, use an 18 kOhm resistor.
