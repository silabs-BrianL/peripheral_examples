opamp_unity_gain

This project configures an opamp as a voltage follower with unity gain. The 
output is routed back to the inverting input and the output voltage is equal to 
the input voltage in value. This configuration is commonly used as a buffer to 
increase drive strength and drive higher loads. This project operates in EM3.

Opamp 2 is used for all of the boards except the radio14 boards 
(BG14, MG14, FG14). Opamp 0 is used for the radio14 boards instead.

This project uses the APORT to route signals to the opamp's input nodes 
and to route the opamp's output to a GPIO pin. The APORT allows for flexible 
configuration on series 1 boards. For series 0 boards, the routing is much more 
limited (in most cases only 1 pin is available for each opamp input and output). 
As a result, the main output is used for series 0 boards. Additionally, the TG11 
uses opamp 2's main output in conjunction with the APORT for routing the 
input to the positive terminal of the opamp (this is because the APORT, despite 
being very flexible, did not coincide with any of the pins brought out to the 
starter kit).

Note: To change the pin mappings for the series 1 projects, refer to the APORT 
section of your board's datasheet and change the mappings accordingly by using 
EMLIB type defines. For series 0 boards, consider using the alternate outputs 
instead (note though that the alternate outputs have a lower drive strength).

How To Test:
1. Build the project and download it to the Starter Kit
2. Use a DC power supply and connect the positive output to the positive 
   input pin of the opamp.
3. Leave the negative input pin of the opamp unconnected because the program 
   configures it to be internally connected to the opamp's output (as defined by 
   a voltage follower)
4. Use an oscilloscope to measure the opamp output pin
5. If successful, the opamp's output voltage will be equal to the input voltage 
   of the power supply.
