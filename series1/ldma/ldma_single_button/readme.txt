ldma_single_button

In this example, the LDMA transfers 128 halfwords (256 bytes)
from one software array to another.  The transfer is requested
by a button press on Push Button 1.

This example is based on the Reference Manual Section 7.4.1:
Chapter: LDMA
Section: Examples
Subsection: Example #1

How to Test:
1) Update the kit's firmware from the Simplicity Launcher (if necessary)
2) Build the project and download the Starter Kit
3) Open Simplicity Debugger and add "dstBuffer" to the Expressions window
4) Add a breakpoint at the beginning of LDMA_IRQHandler()
5) Run the debugger.  After you press the button, the debugger should halt 
inside the interrupt subroutine with the transfer complete (this can be seen 
in the Expressions window)
