em4_wakeup

This project demonstrates the ability for a pin to wake the device from EM4.
Under a normal, non-EM4 reset, the device will enter EM4.
Pressing PB0 will wake the device from EM4 and cause the LEDs on the STK to
toggle indefinitely.

How To Test:
1. Build the project and download to the Starter Kit
2. Observe that the current consumption of the device indicates that it is
    in EM4.
3. Press PB0 to exit EM4.
4. Observe the LEDs blinking, indicating that the last reset cause was
    exit from EM4.
