vcmp_interrupt

This project demonstrates the VCMP to detect battery level thresholds
in EM2.  When the source battery is below the MAX_VOLTAGE (3.0 V), LED0
is off.  When the battery is above MAX_VOLTAGE, LED0 is on.  Interrupts
occur on falling edges to re-evaluate what value LED0 should have.


How To Test:
1. Build the project and download to the Starter Kit
2. Switch the kit to battery mode
3. Connect an external voltage source to the kit(just connect high voltage
to the battery port and connect the grounds). The state of LED0 should 
reflect if the battery voltage is above or below 3.0 V.
