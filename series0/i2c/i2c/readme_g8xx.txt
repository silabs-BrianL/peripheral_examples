i2c

This project demonstrates both master and slave configurations of the 
EFM32 I2C peripheral. Two EFM32 starter kits are connected via a single I2C
bus, and each EFM32 I2C peripheral is setup to both transmit (master mode)
and receive (slave mode). This project exists for all series 0 STKs except
for the Tiny Gecko.

How To Test:
1. Build the project(s) and download to both Starter Kits
2. Connect the SDA and SCL lines between the two kits via the EXP	
   header
3. Press BTN0 of a kit to send data from the respective kit to the other
4. Observe the receive buffer in the IDE variables window to ensure the 
   receive data is correct
