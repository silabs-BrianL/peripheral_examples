i2c

This project demonstrates both master and slave configurations of the 
EFM32 I2C peripheral. Two EFM32 starter kits are connected via a single I2C
bus, and each EFM32 I2C peripheral is setup to both transmit (master mode)
and receive (slave mode). This readme is for the Zero Gecko and Happy Gecko
boards, the Happy Gecko uses the odd GPIO interrupt handler and the Zero 
Gecko uses the even. This project exists for all series 0 STKs except for
the Tiny Gecko.

How To Test:
1. Build the project(s) and download to both Starter Kits
2. Connect the SDA and SCL lines between the two kits via the EXP	
   header
3. Press BTN0 of a kit to send data from the respective kit to the other
4. Observe the receive buffer in the IDE variables window to ensure the 
   receive data is correct
