opamp_differential_two

This project operates in EM3 and configures opamp 0 as a voltage follower and
opamp 1 as a non-inverting opamp. The equation for Vdiff is shown below:

Vdiff = (Vin1 - Vin0) * (R2 / R1)
Vdiff = Vout1 - Vin1
where Vin0 is the input to the positive node of opamp 0 and
Vout1 is the output of opamp 1

By default, this project selects the R2/R1 resistor
ladder ratio to be R2 = 3 * R1. This results in
Vdiff = (Vin1 - Vin0) * 3

This project uses the APORT to route signals to the opamp's input nodes
and to route the opamp's output to a GPIO pin. The APORT allows for flexible
configuration on series 1 boards. For series 0 boards, the routing is much more
limited (in most cases only 1 pin is available for each opamp input and output).
As a result, the main output is used for series 0 boards. Additionally, the TG11
uses opamp 2's main output in conjunction with the APORT for routing the
input to the positive terminal of the opamp (this is because the APORT, despite
being very flexible, did not coincide with any of the pins brought out to the
starter kit).

Note: To change the pin mappings for the series 1 projects, refer to the APORT
section of your board's datasheet and change the mappings accordingly by using
EMLIB type defines. For series 0 boards, consider using the alternate outputs
instead (note though that the alternate outputs have a lower drive strength).

Note: the project for TG11 uses OPA1 and OPA2 because the pin mappings for OPA0
and OPA1 were readily available on the starter kit board.

How To Test:
1. Build the project and download it to the Starter Kit
2. Use a DC power supply with two voltage sources and connect positive output #0
   to the positive input pin of opamp 0 (the OPAMP_P0 or OPA0_P pin).
3. Connect positive output #1 to the positive input pin of opamp 1
   (the OPAMP_P1 or OPA1_P pin).
4. Use an oscilloscope to measure the output of opamp 1 (OPAMP_OUT1 or OPA1_OUT)
5. If successful, the oscilloscope will show
   Vout1 = Vdiff + Vin1
         = (Vin1 - Vin0) * (R2 / R1) + Vin1
