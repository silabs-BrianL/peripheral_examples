pcnt_extclk_single_underflow

This project demonstrates the external clock single input mode of the pulse counter
using interrupts. BTN0 clock is used as the pulse counter clock in this example. The
program requests an interrupt whenever the pulse counter goes below zero.
In this example, each press of Push Button PB0 will decrease the counter value by 1.
The initial value of the counter and the reload value from the top register is set
by the user.

Note for Gecko Gxxx devices, the PRS cannot be used with the PCNT

Prepare to Test:
1. Wire PC5 on expansion header(pin 5) to PE0 on the breakout pad
OR connect a function generator to PC5. The frequency setting for
the function generator should be low enough for user to be able to
observe the pulse difference and notice the toggling of the LED.

How To Test:
1. Build the project and download to the Starter Kit
2. Press Button 7 times ( 6 times to sync the clock)
3. Observe LED0 toggle
4. Press Button 0 12 times (equivalent to 6 pulses)
5. Observe LED0 toggle

When the program is first flashed on to the baord, Button 0 needs to be pressed 7 times to
generate enough pulses to sync the external clock. After that there is no
need to press 6 extra times. Note counter is set to zero originally and will
start reloading the top value after the interrupt.
