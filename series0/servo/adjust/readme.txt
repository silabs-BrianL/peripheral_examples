servo_adjust

This project demonstrates controlling a servo using pulse width modulation 
generated by the TIMER module. Depending on the board, one GPIO button will 
increment the duty cycle and the other will decrement the duty cycle in 1% increments. 
TIMER is initialized for PWM on Compare/Capture channel 0 which is routed to 
the GPIO Pin specified below. In PWM mode, overflow events set the output pin, 
while compare events clear the pin. Thus the overflow value is set to output 
the desired signal frequency, while the CCV is set to control the duty cycle. 
The duty cycle is altered by writing to the CCVB register, which safely updates 
the compare value on the next overflow event.

This example is designed to show the minimal configuration for servo motors,
and is not a fully featured driver. Care should be taken not to exceed the 
specifications of a connected servo motor. This example was designed with an 
MG995 servo.

Peripherals Used:
TIMER0/1 - HFPERCLK (14 MHz for series 0 boards)

================================================================================

How To Test:
1. Build the project and download it to the Starter Kit
2. Use an oscilloscope to view the 1 KHz signal with 30% duty cycle on the GPIO 
   pin specified below
3. Press the GPIO buttons to see the duty cycle change in increments of 1%
