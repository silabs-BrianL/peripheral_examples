servo_sweep

This project demonstrates controlling a servo using pulse width modulation 
generated by the TIMER module. The PWM duty sweeps between 0 and 20% to 
show the servo sweeping through angles. TIMER is initialized for PWM on 
Compare/Capture channel 0 which is routed to the GPIO Pin specified below. 
In PWM mode, overflow events set the output pin, while compare events clear 
the pin. Thus the overflow value is set to output the desired signal frequency, 
while the CCV is set to control the duty cycle. The duty cycle is altered by 
writing to the CCVB register, which safely updates the compare value on the 
next overflow event.

This example is designed to show the minimal configuration for servo motors,
and is not a fully featured driver. Care should be taken not to exceed the 
specifications of a connected servo motor. This example was designed with an 
MG995 servo.

Peripherals Used:
TIMER0/1 - HFPERCLK (14 MHz for series 0 boards)

================================================================================

How To Test:
1. Build the project and download it to the Starter Kit
2. Use an oscilloscope to view the 1 KHz signal change between a duty cycle of 0% to 20%
3. Hook up a servo motor and watch it's horn sweep through it's range of motion
