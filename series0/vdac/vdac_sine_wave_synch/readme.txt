vdac_sine_wave_synch

This project uses the DAC and the internal sine wave generator to produce a
16-point sine wave at a frequency of f_sinewave Hz centered at the reference
voltage divided by 2. This project operates in EM1. By default, this program
outputs a sinewave at 27.343 kHz for series 0 boards and 31.25 kHz for series 1
boards.

Note that the DAC_CLK can only be programmed to a maximum of 1 MHz.
In this example, f_IN_CLK is the HFPERCLK.
Which is (14 MHz for series 0 boards) (19 MHz for series 1 boards).
For series 0 boards: f_DAC_CLK = f_IN_CLK / (2 ^ PRESCALE)
For series 1 boards: f_DAC_CLK = f_IN_CLK / (PRESCALE + 1)

These equations below show how the calculation for the sinewave frequency.
For series 0 boards: f_sinewave = f_HFPERCLK / (32 * (2 ^ PRESCALE)).
For series 1 boards: f_sinewave = f_HFPERCLK / (32 * (PRESCALE + 1))

The PRESCALE bitfield is different for series 0 and series 1 boards. For series
0 boards, the bitfield is 3 bits so the actual prescaler can be any power of 2
between 1 and 128. For series 1 boards, the bitfield is 7 bits so the actual
prescaler can be any number between 1 and 128. The prescaler must be chosen, as
mentioned above, to ensure that the DAC_CLK is less than or equal to 1 MHz.

Although the DAC can operate in EM3 for all series 0 and series 1 boards (except
the original Gecko), synchronous reflexes are clocked on the HFPERCLK so they do
not work in EM2/3 (high frequency clocks get turned off in EM2/3). Furthermore,
the DAC in series 0 boards does not support asynchronous mode so EM1 is the
lowest energy mode possible for a project that uses the DAC and the PRS (such as
this example).

The PRS channel that inputs to DAC/VDAC channel 0 controls the sinewave enable.
The PRS channel that inputs to DAC/VDAC channel 1 controls the output enable.
Both need to be high to see the sinewave output.
The sine wave is output on DAC/VDAC channel 0.

This example used about 1.4 milliamps on average. After commenting out the line
of code that puts the board in EM1, this example used about 2.10 milliamps on
average. Note: this energy measurement was done using Simplicity Studio's
built-in energy profiler for a GG11 board with a Debug build configuration and no
optimization flags (gcc -O0).
